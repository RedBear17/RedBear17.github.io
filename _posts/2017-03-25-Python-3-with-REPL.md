    <td>In today's lesson, instead of doing the exercises on codecademy, we were set challenges by Mr.Keen which we had to solve on REPL. REPL uses Python 3 which is slightly different to codecademy which uses Python 2. Therefore, the skills I had to uses in todayâ€™s lesson is that I had to adapt and use my past knowledge to figure the challenges that was set to me.</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was that I forgot some of the information that was needed to complete the exercises. I need to refine what I know about Python so I can figure problems like the ones I had today. I also need to make my code neater and use functions more so my code is more tidy and efficient.</td>

    <td>Next time, I will try to remember pieces of code that will help me complete the exercises and use more efficient pieces of code like functions so my work is more organised and works better. That is how \i will imprive</td>
