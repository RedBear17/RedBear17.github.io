    <td>In today's lesson, I used past knowledge and perseverance to complete the exercises on Codecademy. The exercises were really hard but I persevered and used information I found out previous exercises and eventually completed the exercises.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was the time it took me to do each exercise. I need to be quicker to figure out the solution to each exercise so I can do more exercises. I also need to look at my work and make sure I fully understand the code so I can do it in future exercises.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will make sure I fully understand the code and I be faster at inputting the code. However, I will not be too fast that I do all the code wrong. IN doing this, I will do more exercises and therefore know more python code. That is how I will improve my learning next lesson.</td>
