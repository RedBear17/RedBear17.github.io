Today, I created my very own Virtual Shop. I used tools I had previously used in spreadsheets when decoding and coding messages and learned new tools to create my shop.

I created items and a price list for my shop. I then created several function is my spreadsheets that would when given what the customer wants and how many of the item the customer wants, it would work out the total cost of what they are spending. 

Firstly I created a section called Item(Customer). I clicked on a cell, went to data, then data validation and selected the cells with the names of the items that I was selling. This let you just need to click and select what you want instead of tying what the customer wants and potentially making a mistake. 

Then I created a section called quantity,where you type in how much of the item the customer wants. Then I created a column called unit price. This used vlookup to find what was in the Item(Customer) column in the price and item columns and insert the price of the item in the cell.

Then I created a Total column. This multiplied the quantity and the unit price to get the total of that item. Then I got a sum total which got the sum of all the prices in the total column which would be the total amount spent in the shop. 

That is how I made my Virtual Shop. Everything I explained showed below.(YOU CAN NOT CHANGE ANYTHING BELOW)
