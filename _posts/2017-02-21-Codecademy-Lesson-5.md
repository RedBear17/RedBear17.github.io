    <td>In today's lesson I learnt by perseverance and reading the instructions carefully and using past knowledge. This week, I fully understood the code once I did it and I was proud of that. I was much faster this week that last week and completed my target which was good. From putting my target from last week into practice(fully understanding the code), I have become much better at the exercises on codecademy.</td>

    <td>The thing I need to work on is my efficiency. I did complete my target, but I think I could have worked much faster in the lesson but i didnâ€™t. If I did this, I could have got more done than I did and therefore I could make my target bigger the next week. </td>

    <td>Next lesson, I will be faster when working so I can get more done. However, I will try not to make silly mistakes when I will be working faster. If I do this, I will get more work done. That is how I will improve my learning next lesson.</td>
