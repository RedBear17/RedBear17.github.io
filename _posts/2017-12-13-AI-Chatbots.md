In today's lesson, we looked at AI chatbots to see what they were and then tried to guess how they worked. We looked at a few chatbots and started to talk to them and looked at their responses.

Most of the responses didn't make grammatical sense or didn’t answer the question you asked or the response was toady not in the context of the conversation. This shows that we haven’t worked out how to get computers to understand us yet. You can show this through Siri, Alexa and google home. When you ask them a question like where is Spain, it will say Spain is a country famous for its good weather. It doesn’t answer your question.

Here are some of the following bots we talked to:

* Mitsuku

* Rose

* Pewdiebot 

* Cleverbot

* Eviebot

When discussing how they worked, we found out hey had a very complex algorithm that when a certain word was typed/said, it would reply with one of the sentences inputted in the code. We also realised that things like Siri or Alexa are list Ning to us all the time which is very creepy.

That is what we talked about in today's lesson.

Here are some of the links to the chatbots:
