  <tr>
    <td>In today's lesson, I learnt by perseverance and using my past knowledge. I tried different bits of code until I got it right and information I learnt from previous lessons helped me to do that. In the end I got through some of the exercises which were really difficult to me.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was that I made silly mistakes and was working quite slowly. This lead to me not achieving my target. However, I found the exercises quite hard. If i didn't make silly mistakes when indenting and worked a bit faster I could have maybe completed my target.</td>

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson, I will check my work so I donâ€™t make silly mistakes when indenting and work a bit faster so I get more work done and complete my excercise. If I do this I will complete my target and be more efficient when coding. That is how I will improve my learning.</td>
