    <td>In today's lesson, I learnt by using past knowledge and checking my work thoroughly. I used what I learnt in the previous lesson to help me complete the exercises in the lesson. I also checked my work for bad use of idents and silly mistakes.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was that I took my time on some of the exercises. If I worked a bit faster I could have done more work. I could have completed my target a lot quicker than I did and could have got more out of the session.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will work more efficiently and will work faster so I can get more work done. IN doing this, I will learn more and be able to do more complicated bits of code. That is how I will improve my learning.</td>
