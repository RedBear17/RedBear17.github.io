In today's lesson, we looked at Buzzfeed quizzes and how they worked. We looked at and tried to understand what methods Buzzfeed quizzes to determine what your outcome will be. For example, which Cars character you would be based on some questions.

We first completed a few Buzzfeed quizzes to see what they were and to try and see how they worked. The format would be a quiz that would determine what house you would be in in Harry potter by asking several questions. The way you answer the question determines what house the quiz says you are in. For example, a question might be, what do you do at parties. The options might be the following:

1. Chat to everyone(Gryffindor answer)

2. Be a loner(Ravenclaw answer)

3. Don't go a do things in your room…(Slytherin answer)

4. Eat!!!(Hufflepuff answer)

If you choose the Slytherin answer the most you would be in Slytherin etc… However, how does it work when coding a quiz like this. Well, there are several ways of doing this. You could do a tree format. This is where you ask one main question with 3 answers. Each answer has its own individual question with 3 answer an so on. However, this is a lot of coding and it will make a very long time. 

Another way of doing it is a point system. You ask a question and that question can have 4 answers for example. Each answer would be related to a house. If we take Slytherin, Slytherin could have be worth +10 points. So for every Slytherin answer, 10 points will be added to a score. Then for a Gryffindor answer, 10 points will be minused. You will start with a certain amount of points, 80 for example, and then at the end of all the questions, the amount of points left over will tell you what house you are in. For example, if you end up with 35 points, you are in Slytherin house. That is the system I am using for my Buzzfeed quiz.

A plan of my Buzzfeed quiz is the post below this one in my blog. That is what we did in today's lesson.
