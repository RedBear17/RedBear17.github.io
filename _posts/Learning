In school we are mostly taught to learn lots of facts and remember them for an exam to get a label to say if someone is stupid or not. Exams only test your memory. However, the high paying jobs don’t require memory, they require skill. Unique ways of thinking like computational thinking. It is like problem solving. Trying different methods to fix problems instead of asking for help.

Some people are not suited for schools, especially not grammar schools. Some people are good at hands on things and physical activities where others are good at academic things. That is why people should go to certain schools to suit themselves, not just because a school has good reviews. That doesn’t mean you will do where there as the school might not be for you.
