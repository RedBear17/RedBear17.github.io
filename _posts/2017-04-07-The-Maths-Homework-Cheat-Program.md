    <td>In today's lesson we were set a challenge. We had to use all of our knowledge on python and put everything together to create a program that could solve basic maths problems. I had to check my work to make sure there was no mistakes that would ruin the program.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was that I didnâ€™t know some of the things I needed to do the program but I figured it out when I was coding as it just popped up into my head and it worked,.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I create a program like this, I will use functions more so I will be more efficient and my work will be more tidy because of it. I will also remember the basics so it will be easier to do it. That is how I will improve my learning. </td>
