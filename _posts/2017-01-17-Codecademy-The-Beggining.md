    <td>Today's lesson we started a whole new thing called codecademy-we are using this website to learn python and doing the exercises so we can get familiar with the program. The learning strategies that were effective this lesson was perseverance. I needed to do this to so I could understand the code eventually-even if it took me several attempts.</td>

    <td>The thing that limited my learning was minding the little details like Capital letters. If I missed out little things like capital letters, it would slow me down as I would have to fix it. If I was more careful, I wouldn’t of have to check for the mistakes and could of got more exercises done.

    <td>Next time, I will be more careful and be slower when typing so I don’t make grammatical errors/missing out Capital errors. If I do this, I will do more work and be more efficient. I wouldn’t be checking for errors as often if I was more careful. That is how I will improve my learning next lesson when coding in python.</td>
