    <td>In today's lesson, I learnt by reading the instructions carefully and understanding the code. I fully understood the code and read the instructions carefully so I could understand the code and I put what I learnt into the other exercises I did.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that I need to improve on so I can improve my learning is my pace. I need to be faster when working so i could have got more done and completed my target. If I was more efficient, I would have completed my target. That is what limited my learning.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will be more efficient when working. I will be faster when coding but no so fast that I make silly mistakes. If I do this, I will complete my target and get more work done and therefore know more about coding in python. That is how I will improve my learning.</td>
