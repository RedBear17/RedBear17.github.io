In today's lesson, we learnt how to incorporate functions and procedures into our Buzzfeed quizzes. By using functions and procedures, it makes coding more clear and easier to understand and makes it easier to code as when planning on making a program, you can make the functions/procedures based on the plan.

Functions and procedures are great and useful when coding(explained in previous blogs). When creating a long program, like a Buzzfeed quiz, it is good to make it using functions and procedures. The main reason is because it will let you write less code than you need to. Instead of writing lots of while loops in a row(like I am doing at the moment) you can use one loop that will do that loop for all your questions in a list. Talking about lists, you can use one list to store all your questions and answers instead of having them scattered in one very long bit of code. By using lists, functions and procedures, it makes your code easier to write, understand and make it more condense.

I found creating the procedure for the introduction to my quiz easy but I found printing one question at a time from my list quite difficult. I couldn't do the right loop to make it take my first question and print it and then move onto the next procedure or function.

That is what we learnt in today's lesson.
