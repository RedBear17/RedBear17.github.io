In today's lesson, I used the ideas and concepts I used to create my Buzzfeed quiz to create a story. I used while loops and if functions to make the person running the program to choose an option to carry on the story told in a different way. This tasked made sure I still knew how to use the skills I learnt months ago and applied this to a new task.

Next time, I could create a random story generator where the user inputs a selection of words and these words make up a story as I will have the foundation of the story already set. This will be done by using functions and procedures and using the input function. That is what I might attempt to do next lesson
