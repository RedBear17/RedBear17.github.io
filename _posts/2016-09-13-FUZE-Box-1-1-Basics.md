  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by reading the booklet and inputting the code onto the programme. Then I opened a new program and did the assessments at the end of the exercise to make sure I knew how to use the code I was just taught. Then I also tried out some new things with the code- used it to change the colours of the page, say things to me etc... </td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My efficiency limited my learning as I was a bit slow but I still got the work done. I was slow because I was reading all the information in the booklet. I was reading why the code does what it does and not just copying the code in without understanding it. If I was more efficient, I could of done at least one more exercise. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will be faster in doing the coding, but still being precise and not making a mistake. I will still read the explanation of the coding but maybe skim-read it so I can do more work. That is how I will improve my learning</td>
