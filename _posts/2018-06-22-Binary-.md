In today's lesson, we recapped how binary works and what it is used for. Computers operate in binary, meaning they store data and perform calculations using only zeros and ones. You can represent any number using binary. Instead of counting using powers of tens(units, tens, hundreds, thousands etc) binary use powers of two(2, 4, 8, 16, 32 etc). You put a one for a number you do want and then a zero for a number you donâ€™t want. For example, 10 is made from 2 and 8 so is 101 in binary. However, binary is difficult when it comes to decimals as if you have a recurring decimal, it is impossible to represent it.

We also learnt about how things may seem funny and alright at the time of doing something but in fact it might not be funny at all and could be illegal. We also learnt why calling someone a snitch is not a good thing as the person snitching just wants to stop getting bullied by the person bullying them and by saying snitch you are encouraging the bully.  That is what we learnt.
