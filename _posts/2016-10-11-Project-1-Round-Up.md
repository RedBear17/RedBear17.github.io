  <tr>
    <td>Today, I learnt by reading the code carefully as it was the end of project round up and there was a lot of hard code. It was really hard and complicated to read and if you got one thing wrong, it was a pain to fix as you had too look through so much code. So reading it carefully was key to getting through most of it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was nothing really. This week nothing really limited my learning. I got through as much as I could get through. The only reason I did not reach my target is because there was so much code to do!</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will work at the same pace as this week and get as much work as I can done. Possibly, I could set myself a target to type faster/read faster to get more work done. That is what I am going to do for next week. I will also challenge myself to change more in my blog to make it more interesting and unique.</td>
