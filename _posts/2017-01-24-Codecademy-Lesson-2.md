    <td>In today's lesson, I used past knowledge to complete the python exercises on codecademy. In the exercises I did today, I had to use the knowledge I learned from previous exercises and apply it to new information I learned. That allowed me to proceed and learn something new.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my learning in today’s lesson was that I didn't focus on little details. I kept missing out semicolons in one of the exercises which stopped me from moving on. If I read the instructions more carefully and typed slower, I would have done the exercises faster and completed more exercises as well.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will read the instructions more carefully and be slower when typing so I don’t make as many mistakes. I will check my work more to find the silly mistakes before the program finds them for me. If I do this I  will do more and be more efficient when coding. That is what I will do next time.</td>
