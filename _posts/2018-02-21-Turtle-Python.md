In today's lesson, we learnt what turtle python was, how to use it and what it is useful for. Turtle python is like python but you can import turtle into it. With turtle, you can create shape and patterns if you use the right code.

First you have to write import turtle to do anything in turtle python that is different from normal python. Then you have to decide the turtles speed and the turtles shape so you can see something on the screen.

Then, to draw any shape you want, you have to make this easy procedure. You first need to define a procedure with sides and length in the brackets and then in that procedure, you need to create a for loop in range of sides. Then you need to make it go forward in terms of its length and make it turn left or right by 360 divided by the number of sides. You do this because it will give you the exterior angle which will make all the lines join up properly. Then you run the procedure but in the brackets put the numbers of sides you want the shape to have first, put a comma and then put the side length you want in. That is how to make any regular shape in turtle python. 

To make patterns and other cool looking things in turtle python, you can change the colours of the line as they change direction by creating a list called colours and adding names of colours into the list and then when running the procedure, you put it in a for loop in the list colours and then type turtle.color(color) to choose a colour from the list. This will make your shape multicoloured. To make a pattern, you put the procedure in a while loop and then in the loop make the turtle turn right by 7 degrees for example. The program will draw the shape a infinite amount of times and each time the shape moves slightly making a pattern. You can make the thickness of your line more thick by using turtle.pensize().

Here is the pattern I created:

Here are some patterns I found on the internet:
