    <td>Today I learnt by persevering and teamwork. Today we collaborated ideas with another group who were stuck on the same thing and worked it out together byu persevering and learning a couple of new things on the way. In the end, we did it and learned a lot of new things like for  all wires and LED's etc… to be connected, They all had to be on the same vertical line on the breadboard.</td>

    <td>The thing that limited my learning was that we were working with other partners. It slowed us down as there were more of us, however, without them, I don’t think either of us could have done it(well not in the hour lesson). That is what limited my learning this lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will try and solve problems by myself without collaborating with other partners and try and persevere even more. I will look at the obvious and just try things out and see if they work. I will read ALL the information on the textbook and next time I will get everything right and my learning would have been  improved.</td>
