In today's lesson, I managed to complete my Buzzfeed quiz. In this blog, I am going to say how I created my Buzzfeed quiz and then at the end, you can try it out. I took a bit of time and planing on how it would work and what questions I was going to ask, but I did it in the end.

First, I planned on how to create my quiz(you can see this plan on a previous blog). I planned on using while loops to create my questions and store my answers and add or subtract a number depending on what answer the unser choose to determine what Star Wars character they were.

I first printed my opening instructions and created a variable called amount which will make sense later. Then I made my first question. I created a while loop and put the following inside the loop. I created a variable called answer1 and stored the input what the user typed to answer the question. Then I created an if statement that added 10 to the variable amount for example, if you chose "a". I did this for all the options you could choose in that question adding or minusing numbers. Then I repeated this for all 7 questions.

Then I created a while loop that would say you were a Jedi for example, if the total amount at the end was between 9 and 49. I created this 4 times for the 4 possibles things you would be by completing the quiz using different boundaries everytime. Depending on what answers you choose, your amount would go down if you were answering the questions like a Jedi and they would go up if you were answering like a Sith. That is how I created my Buzzfeed quiz.
