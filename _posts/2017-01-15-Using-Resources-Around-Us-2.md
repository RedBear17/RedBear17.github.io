    <td>In Today's lesson we didn’t use the Fuse boxes, we had a talk about trying new things out and using W3Schools (http://www.w3schools.com/) to improve our blogs. I used my past knowledge and trying new things to make my blog better.

Mr Keen said we should try new things in our blogs and not just wait until we are told to do something as you can always change it if it doesn’t work. We should should use W3Schools more so our blogs look great. So that is what I did.</td>

    <td>Because of this lesson, I improved my blog by trying new things out. I combined different bits of code to improve my table. I used made my table header turn red and my whole table be slightly transparent. To do this though, I had to turn every single title in my blog to a table header individually.I used my previous knowledge of the opacity code and applied to something new that I learned.</td>
