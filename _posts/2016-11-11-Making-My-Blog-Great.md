    <td>Today I learnt how to improve my blog by Mr.Keen talking about faults in people's blogs and telling us to improve them with some tips that he gave us. Learning strategies that were effective was reflection on my blog to see what to improve and perseverance so I could change what was wrong without giving up.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my learning was that I weren't thinking flexibly. I was narrow-minded while I was working on the blog and until I changed my way of thinking, I couldnâ€™t change anything in my blog to make it a good blog. Some of the things I wanted to put in my blog was so easy to do but I was just making it to complicated for myself.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I change my blog, I will change my way of thinking and use http://www.w3schools.com/ to help me change my blog. I will also apply past knowledge to improve my blog even more and change the little things that make a big impact on the way my blog will look. That is how I will change my way of learning next time.</td>
