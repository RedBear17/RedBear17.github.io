    <td>In today's lesson, I learnt by using past knowledge and reading the instructions more carefully so I don’t make silly mistakes and overlook things. In doing this, I did the exercises without stressing on what I did  wrong.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning this time was my efficiency. I was too slow doing the exercises so I didn’t reach my target because of that. If I was faster, I would have got more done and would have completed my target.</td>

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will do my work a little bit faster so I can get more work done. However, I will still pay close attention to the instructions so I don’t make silly mistakes that will slow me down. That is how I will improve my learning so I will do better next lesson.</td>
