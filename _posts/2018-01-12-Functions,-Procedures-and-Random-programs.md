In today's lesson, we learnt about Functions, Procedures and things being random. We learnt what the differences were between Functions and Procedures and learnt what they would be used for in bits of code. We also learnt how "random" things are not random in computer programs as well.

You define a function the same way you define a procedure. The difference between the two things is that a function will do things with the information you give it and remember information given to it and a procedure won't remember information.  To create a function, you use return. Return stores the information you are inputting in it so you can use it. A procedure doesn’t return the information. It does what you tell it to do, but doesn’t store the information so it can’t print the answer. For example, it you define a procedure to add two to any number and you tell it to add 3 to 2, it  would work out work 2+3 is but not store the answer 5 and forget about it, whereas a function would store the answer.

A Function would be used where you need to store information the program is working out for you, like a high score of a game, an answer to a sum and other things like that. A procedure is used if you want the program to do this thing once, for example print text, print the instructions on how to play the game etc…

Here is an example of functions and procedures used in Python:

In computer program's, we learnt that things can not possibly be random ever. If you program something to choose a number between 1 and 10, it won’t be random. There is a percentage chance of the number being 1, a percentage number for it being 2 ect...It is impossible for a computer program to do something at random as it can't.  We looked at a game called Backgammon which is a game involving dice rolls, which are meant to be random, however it always seems the AI gets all the good rolls when it needs them which is very unlikely to happen every time and when you need to get a roll, you don’t get them.

The only thing which is truly random in computer programs, is if you use truly random numbers. This is where the computer measures some type of physical phenomenon that takes place outside of the computer. For example, the noise level of somewhere outside. Someone would record the sound through a microphone and measure it and use that number to generate a truly random number. That is what we learnt in today's lesson.
