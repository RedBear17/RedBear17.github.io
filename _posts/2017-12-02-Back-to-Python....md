In today's lesson, we recapped the basics of Python that we learned last year. We created a small program that used the basic ideas and functions in Python. We created a program that asked us a few questions and responded when the user answers the questions.

To create this program, we used variables and while loops. We created a variable that contains a an answer to a question that was asked(i.e. what is your name?). The variable stores the answer to the question.

For questions that can have multiple answers, we would control the answers you could put into the program so there couldn't be infinite answers. You could choose from 2 options or choose from a, b, c or d for example. Then we would use the if function to reply to the user once they answer the question depending on the answer. For example, if you answered a, it would sa good. If you said b, it would say bad etcâ€¦ If none of the options were picked, it would keep repeating the loop and not break it.

We did this several times with different functions to create our little program.
